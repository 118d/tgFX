This code is under heavy development.
'''Use this code at your own RISK!'''
Please note that tgFX is NOT backwards compatible with firmware older tinyg firmware versions.  tgFX will notify you if your TinyG firmware is too old.


Getting Started
==
Most people want to know where to get the binary download for tgFX and move on.  While this is possible, we urge you to read the wiki pages on how to use tgFX with TinyG.  Using any software to control CNC machines can be dangerous and is definitely woth the time of taking 10 minutes to read tgFX's wiki pages for saftey's sake.  That being said please refer to <a href="https://github.com/synthetos/tgFX/edit/master/README.md#software-disclaimer">Synthetos LLC's Software Disclaimer</a>.




Usage and Instructions
==
Instructions on installing, using and configuring tgFX with TinyG can be found on the tgFX wiki located here:
https://github.com/synthetos/tgFX/wiki

Thanks and remember that tgFX is still in beta. Try running a job with the motors inhibited before attempting to cut.
