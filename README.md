A JavaFX 2 based GUI controller for the TinyG motion controller.

This code is under heavy development.  We should be approaching a new release soon.  However, please note that tgFX is NOT backwards compatible with firmware versions 357.01 and lower.

To run tgFX you will need to update your TinyG's firware to 357.01.

If you would like to setup your development enviroment for Mac we have a wiki page here.
